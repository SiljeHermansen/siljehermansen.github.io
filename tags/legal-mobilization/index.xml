&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation is the fuel that makes the European Union’s (EU) legal order work. By going to court, private and public actors can claim their EU rights, argue their case before the European Court of Justice (ECJ), and shape subsequent debates and supranational policies. In this chapter, we situate EU law litigation in a broader comparative context by answering three questions: who litigates EU law, who influences ECJ decisions, with what downstream effects? We first draw on existing empirical legal studies (ELS) to compare whether well-established litigation patterns in the United States also appear to arise in the EU. 
While research in both contexts suggests that it is the “haves” (businesses and interest groups clustered in cities) who disproportionately litigate, studies of the EU context disagree about whether the capacity to litigate automatically begets judicial influence and downstream effects. To advance this debate, we systematically map the litigation propensities and relative influence of various types of litigants using an original dataset of 7353 cases referred by national courts to the ECJ from 1957 to 2018. We uncover several illuminating patterns that open pathways for future research. First, EU law litigation is not only driven by resourceful business and trade associations, but also by a surprising abundance of resourceless individuals and a striking paucity of labor unions and advocacy groups, although these patterns vary across member states. Second, individuals, labor unions, and trade associations are most effective in influencing the ECJ, but in opposing and counterintuitive ways: whereas labor unions and individuals prompt liberalizing rulings that restrict national autonomy, trade associations prompt protectionist rulings that safeguard national autonomy. Finally, individuals and advocacy groups are better able to attract attention and shape downstream legal debates via EU law litigation than businesses and trade associations. The “haves” are certainly protagonists of EU law litigation, but they are neither the sole nor the most effective protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does the CJEU relate to its external interlocutors; litigants, the legal community and governments? These projects argue that the CJEU actively seeks alliance partners beyond governments. They also explore how the Court pursues its own interests without running against member states&amp;rsquo; wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courtroom capital: Who lawyers know or what they know?&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tommasopavone.com/&#34;&gt;Tommaso Pavone&lt;/a&gt; and Louisa Boulaziz presented at EUSA 2025 (Philadelphia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research consistently demonstrates that experienced lawyers achieve better outcomes in court. However, it remains unclear whether knowledge of court procedures or lawyers&amp;rsquo; familiarity with the judges drives these results. We argue that a lawyer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;courtroom capital&amp;rdquo; is primarily rooted in their familiarity with specific judges. Given the significance of knowing the judges, we also anticipate that lawyers are more likely to win  in court when they argue cases orally in court, in front of judges they are acquainted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigate our claims in the context of the General Court of the European Union, where lawyers may encounter different judges and not all cases have oral hearings. We find that it is familiarity with the reporting judge, and not familiarity with court procedures, that increases lawyers win rates. Our results also reveal that lawyers familiarity with judges only pays off in cases with oral hearings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judicious judging: The effects of political division on decision making in the European Court of Justice&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eui.eu/people?id=urska-sadl&#34;&gt;Urska Sadl&lt;/a&gt; presented at APSA 2022 (Montréal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do courts react to political debate? Their legitimacy hinges on their ability to uphold the law impervious to political pressure. The authority of the ruling follows from the court&amp;rsquo;s reputation as apolitical. Politicization – understood as salient questions that divide stakeholders – threatens to erode this image. It imposes conflicting demands: Courts can prove their worth by solving questions for which there is a demand for a legal solution, but they risk their reputation in a politically divided environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Integration_sd_over_time.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;The number of judgements with wide legal ambit is low when member state governments have diverse preferences on European integration, and more numerous when government preferences are more homogeneous.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literature on judicial independence focuses on direct and explicit threats issued by the political branch. Arguments of legislative override typically predict that political division empowers the judiciary. In contrast, we argue that courts are sensitive even to the potential eruption of conflict because they value their diffuse legitimacy. Effective judicial policy making is thus a question of strategic timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test our theory, we study the European Court of Justice. Known as the “dark horse of integration”, it is an independent court with political sway. Yet political considerations profoundly affects its decision making. We draw on unprecedented data mapping out the legal ambit of all preliminary cases relating to the Free movement of people throughout the history. We find that the Court holds back on the legal ambit of rulings, preferring to bolster its institutional authority, in times of political division. Reversely, it broadens the ambit when salience is high and conflict low. Thus, when salience and division combine, they null each other out; leaving traces only in the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--* **Litigating in the European Court of Justice: Lawyers&#39; influence on supranational decision-making** with [Tommaso Pavone](https://www.tommasopavone.com/) and Louisa Boulaziz presented at ECPR 2021 (zoom)

This paper assesses how private litigants’ propensity to win cases before international courts is conditioned by the quality of their legal counsel and by the constraints of intergovernmental politics. Building on legal mobilization and party capability theories, we argue that quality legal counsel bolsters a private party’s capacity to convey legal information to judges that is relevant to deciding the case in their favor. At the same time, we build on intergovernmentalist theories of international adjudication positing that judges will also be sensitive to political signals by national governments. As a result, we hypothesize that the influence of quality legal counsel on international judges is conditioned by the political support that member states&#39; express. 

To assess these claims, we exploit an original dataset of parties and lawyers involved in disputes before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) – arguably the most successful and influential international court procuring access to private litigants. We find being represented by a lawyer bolsters the probability that litigants submit observations and win cases before the ECJ, yet this effect is the highest in the minority of cases where a majority of more member state governments intervene in favor of the applicant. We conclude by highlighting the necessity of combining theories of legal mobilization and intergovernmental politics in order to explain judicial decision-making in international courts. --&gt; 
&lt;!--* **&#34;Measuring the evolution of CJEU case law using word embeddings&#34;** presented at Big Insight - a center for research-based innovation, Norwegian Computing Center 2019 (Oslo)

To study the conditions for judicial activism – self-restraint, initiation or expansion of case law – we need a consistent and comparable measure of court output. Can machine learning help us in this respect? This research note discusses ways of comparing court documents in order to obtain such measures. The focus is on word embeddings, which allow researchers to identify similar – but not identical – terms and use them as building blocks for document-level comparisons.

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Effect_of_judgment_similarity_on_academic_attention.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; alt=&#34;Effect of judgment similarity on academic attention (annotations in legal journals).&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

Analyzing the evolution of case law requires researchers to read and compare judgments. It is a resource-intensive process both in terms of competence and number of working hours. Assessing the outcome of a case typically requires familiarity with legal precedent in the court, the doctrines under- pinning rulings as well at the type of cases brought before the tribunal. In other words, - depending on the task – the researcher needs a good grasp of similar cases in the past (i.e. legal precedent) and/or the future (i.e. its value as a precedent) as well as the field-specific vocabulary.

The purpose of this research note is to train a model to make such comparisons for us. To obtain word embeddings, I apply a word2vec algorithm on 30999 (machine-readable) legal texts produced by the members of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) itself. I use these to construct a do- main specific vocabulary of similar words. The similarities can then be used to identify and compare relevant documents based on their word occurrences.
