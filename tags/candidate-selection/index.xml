      <title>Lingering bias: the effects of legislated gender quotas on representation quality in the European Parliament</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does biased political recruitment -- and the legislation of gender quotas -- affect the quality of representation? The article theorizes that biased selection implies a higher hurdle for women than for men. As a consequence, fewer -- but more talented and ambitious -- female legislators enter office. When quotas are legislated, the bias lingers but takes new forms. Uncertain about their initial choice, parties compensate by drawing on incumbent women&#39;s legislative record to update their beliefs. Quota women are thus more accountable.
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a &amp;ldquo;before-after&amp;rdquo; design with a control group, this study investigates legislators&amp;rsquo; effort, performance, ambition, and reselection to the European Parliament (1999-2014). It demonstrates that non-quota women handled more high-impact legislation and aimed at longer careers than other legislators. When quotas were imposed, the share of women did not increase. However, quota women had a higher pay off from performing well in office and reacted by increasing their effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blurred lines between electoral and parliamentary representation: The use of constituency staff among Members of the European Parliament</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentarians receive public funding to employ staff in the constituency helping them execute their representative mandate. However, local staff is also an electoral asset. We draw on theories of personal-vote seeking to study local staff as an example of constituency service. Modelling within-individual changes in local-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), we find that staff size increases before both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centred systems. This leads us to conclude that - despite a single staff system for all MEPs - EU citizens are represented differently depending on where they elect their members. The attempt to mend EU&#39;s democratic deficit by financing members&#39; contact with citizens further implies funding incumbent European candidates and challengers in national campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing COMEPELDA: Comprehensive European Parliament electoral data covering rules, parties and candidates</title>
      <link>https://siljehermansen.github.io/publication/eup2022/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new collection of data that consolidates information on European Parliament elections into one comprehensive source. It provides information on formal electoral rules as well as national-level and district-level election results for parties and individual politicians (including full candidate lists). The use of existing and new key variables makes it easy to link the data across the different units of observation (country, party, candidate, member of parliament) and join them with external information. Currently, the data cover four elections (1999–2014). Among other aspects, the collection should facilitate research on the European Parliament&#39;s allegedly weak electoral connection. In this article, we outline the main features of the datasets, describe patterns of intra-party competition and preference voting and conduct exploratory analyses of individual-level changes in list positions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Striving for influence: The effect of performance on candidate selection</title>
      <link>https://siljehermansen.github.io/publication/pp2018/</link>

&lt;img src=&#34;reselection_performance.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Effect of signals of performance on incumbent candidate selection to the European Parliament. Author: Silje Hermansen.&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider how asymmetric information between the party selectorate and members of Parliament affects the renomination of incumbent candidates. By applying an adverse selection model, I argue that the selectorate looks to past performance to select candidates it expects will gain influence. However, the impact of performance varies according to the need for and availability of information.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The European Parliament (EP) provides a most-likely case for information asymmetry. Studying three elections in 11 member states, I find that the allocation of influential positions in office improves chances of reselection. The effect increases when the allocation is more selective, and when the prior uncertainty around candidacies is high. The study thus proposes a new approach to the relationship between national parties and transnational groups in the EP. It also suggests venues for research on parliamentary politics and candidate selection in general. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Choosing Agents: Members of the European Parliament and their Political Organizations Seen through Report Allocation</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dissertation treats with partisan organization in the European Parliament (EP) and its impact on members’ (MEPs) career opportunities. National parties organize elections. Parliamentary work is organized around transnational political groups. They do not share any overarching organizational structure. My contributions pertain to the interconnected choices made by MEPs and their two party organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and -- up to a point -- experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report alloca-tions dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
