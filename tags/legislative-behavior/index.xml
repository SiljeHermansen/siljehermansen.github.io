&lt;p&gt;Political parties obtain influence through their choice of representatives. &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; of parliament, they gain sway through the candidates for whom they secure election. &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt; parliament party groups shape policies through the allocation of tasks to competent members. This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter
into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report allocations dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blurred lines between electoral and parliamentary representation:  The use of constituency staff among European Members of Parliament&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pegan.org/&#34;&gt;Andreja Pegan&lt;/a&gt;, presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2017 (Vienna)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political actors receive public funding to execute their mandate. Spending that money for electoral purposes, however, undermines democratic representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigate to what extent parliamentary spending increases during campaign periods and how the electoral system affects such behavior. Specifically, we model within-individual changes in constituency-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament. We find that local spending increases prior to both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centered systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Coefplot_ElectoralSystem.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; alt=&#34;Coefplot displaying the predicted number of local assistants by electoral system.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that EU citizens are represented differently depending on their nationality. Insofar as constituency staff creates an incumbency advantage, the system also generates inequalities between candidates which public funding aims to equalize. Moreover, the attempt to mend Parliament’s democratic deficit by financing members’ contact with citizens also implies funding national electoral campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Do Legislated Gender Quotas Impact Representation?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Working paper presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2016 (Brussels)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does biased political recruitment – and the subsequent legislation of quotas – affect the quality of women’s performance as representatives in Parliament? I draw on insights from the literature on political agency to distinguish between the effects of selection and sanction.  First, if recruitment in the absence of quotas implies higher requirements for women, then selected women are of higher quality. Second, when quotas lower the bar, new women enter office.  However, parties are less certain about the quality of these women and react by increasing accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I investigate representation in the European Parliament (1999-2014) before and after the legislation of quotas in several member states.  Absent quotas, I find that biased selection leads to female representatives who pursue longer careers and perform better at equal levels of effort. When quotas are legislated, parties emphasize women’s service records during reselection.  Women are thus incentivized to put in more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament (EP) is a committee-oriented legislature; meaning that the bulk of legislative work is done in committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. We argue that groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer loyal policy experts to generalists and &amp;ndash; up to a point &amp;ndash; experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;EffectOfSpecialization.png&#34; alt=&#34;The positive effect of staying in the same committee decreases over time.&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committee coordinators face a classic delegation problem when assigning reports to their committee members. Although few theoretical developments have focused on the eﬀects of expertise on delegation, empirical studies have commonly assumed monotonic eﬀects. Based on the theoretical model by Fischer and Stocken (2001), we argue that more expertise, holding preference divergence constant, has a non-monotonic eﬀect on the probability of being appointed as a rapporteur because of informational credibility. Employing accumulated committee service as an expertise measure, we test this theoretical expectation on all committee report delegations in the European Parliament from 1979 - 2014. Across both nonparametric and parametric hierarchical conditional logit models we ﬁnd support for this non-monotonic eﬀect. The results hold across member states, political groups, procedures, committees, and over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;coefplot_expertise.png&#34; alt=&#34;Coefplot reporting effect of policy expertise on allocation of codecision reports. Author: Silje Hermansen.&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapporteurs in the European Parliament (EP) are the most influential members in terms of the legislation they handle. They are appointed by their political groups. In making these appointments, these groups need to accommodate both their collective needs and individual requests.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;This article explores situations in which the collective need for information is prioritised: the codecision procedure. The data includes allocations over a 10-year period (2004–2014) in three of the most powerful EP committees, as well as key career choices among members.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;EP groups emphasise policy-specific expertise. They also pay attention to individual members’ requests for exposure, but only when the expected policy drift is minimal. Harsh selection during the allocation of codecision reports creates pressure to accommodate a greater selection of legislators during other attractive report allocations. Own-initiative reports therefore affect allocation of codecision reports negatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dissertation treats with partisan organization in the European Parliament (EP) and its impact on members’ (MEPs) career opportunities. National parties organize elections. Parliamentary work is organized around transnational political groups. They do not share any overarching organizational structure. My contributions pertain to the interconnected choices made by MEPs and their two party organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and -- up to a point -- experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report alloca-tions dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
