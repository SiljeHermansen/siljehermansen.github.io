&lt;!---This course provides a toolkit for students looking to execute their own research projects using quantitative methods. We explain the statistical theory behind models, but we emphasize understanding when different models are useful and how to employ them.

The course helps students 1) identify appropriate statistical models that describe different data types and 2) design studies that enable causal inference (as opposed to merely establishing correlation).


## Describing data (generalized linear models)

Many of the phenomena political scientists take interest in can be classified into categories or events. This includes variables like voters&#39; choice of party, number of violent incidences in a time span, or time between violent events. The course introduces students to a number of models which are specifically designed to describe the underlying phenomenon that generates such data. The focus of the first part of the course is on correlations. Our purpose is to help students gear the statistical analysis towards a realistic description of the data.

#### Lecture 1: Maximum likelihood
*(Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 1, 2, 5-7)*

We introduce maximum likelihood as a framework for statistical modeling.

#### Lecture 2: [Models of outcome and choice: The logit model](logit_model_stv4020b.pdf)
*(Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 3)*

Logistic regression is the base-line example of a generalized linear model (GLM).
We go through how to model binary outcomes, how to interpret the results from a logit and why we can&#39;t simply run an OLS.

#### Lecture 3: [Models of outcome and choice: Ordered and multinomial regression](choice_models_stv4020b.pdf)
*(Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 8-9)*

We go through models with categorical dependent variables: Ordinal and nominal categories. Example data used in class can be downloaded [here](kap10.txt). It is the same as the data from chapter 10 in laerdegR.


#### Lecture 4: [Event count models: Poisson regression and other alternatives](count_models_stv4020b.pdf)
*(Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 10)*

Event count models describe grouped events. They are appropriate when we do not have relevant information at the event level, but are able to both count them and design contextual predictors. We go through the poisson model and how to check for overdispersion. We then consider different strategies to adress possible overdispersion. We study the quasi-poisson and the negative binomial models as well as hurle and zero-inflated models.

Towards the end of the lecture, we consider the [decision tree for determining which GLM model](https://siljehermansen.github.io/teaching/choose_glm) might best describe our data.

#### Lecture 5: Event history/duration models
*(Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 11)*

We can leverage information both from the fact that an event occured or not (binary outcome) and the time it took for the event to take place (count outcome). These models are made to describe a duration until an outcome occurs.


## Causal inference

Beyond statistical description, researchers&#39; interest in political phenomena is often motivated by a wish to identify their causes. Causal claims focus on whether we would continue to observe $y$ even in the absence of $x$. This is a typical question when studying the effect of policies, for example. The potential outcomes framework helps us understand the conditions under which we can identify causal relationships.  The second part of the course is devoted to a set of quantitative research designs that can be used to make causal inferences.


#### [Causal inference](causal_inference_stv4020b.pdf)
*(Morgan and Winship, 2015, ch 1-3; Samii 2016)*

We go through the idea of potential outcomes. What are the comparisons we would we like to make? And what is actually possible to compare with?

In the R-lab we&#39;ll look at matching techniques. We will play with a version of the [data](judges.rda) from Glyn and Sen&#39;s daughters-effect paper in [APSR](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/daughters.pdf) from 2014.


#### Regression and matching
*(Ho et al., 2007; Iacus, King and Porro, 2011)*

We introduce matching as a technique to adjust for observed confounders.

####  [RDD and diff-in-diff](RDD_diff-in-diff_stv4020b.pdf)
*(Angrist and Pischke, 2015, ch 4 and 5; Wing, Simon and Bello-Gomez, 2018; Imbens and Lemieux 2008)*

We go through regression discontinuity designs (RDD) where a treatment kicks in at a certain cutpoint of an observed running variable. We then have a look at the differences-in-differences approach (diff-in-diff) where we observe a treatment group and a control group before and after the treatment. It&#39;s all about interaction effects and dummies!

We&#39;ll play around with data on young adults, deathrates and alcohol both from [chapter 4](df_ch4.rda) and [chapter 5](df_ch5.rda).

#### Instrumental variables
*(Sovey and Green, 2011)*

We introduce instrumental variables and provide guidelines for their application in political science.

### Readings
We will use the following assigned readings:

* *Ward and Ahlquist (2018)* will introduce students to maximum likelihood as a framework for statistical modelling, different generalized linear models suited for various data types frequently encountered in political science, model selection strategies, and methods for interpreting and presenting empirical results.  This is the resource we will use for the first part of the course. 
* Chapters 1-3 in *Morgan and Winship (2015)* will  introduce  students  to  the  potential outcomes framework for causal inference and causal graphs, while *Samii (2016)* reviews the turn towards “causal empiricism” in political science that builds on these ideas.
* *Ho et al. (2007)* and *Iacus, King and Porro (2011)* introduce matching as a technique to adjust for observed confounders. 
* Chapter 4 in *Angrist and Pischke (2014)* will introduce students to regression discontinuity designs, while *Imbens and Lemieux (2008)* provide more detailed advice for the use of this design in applied research. 
* Chapter 5 in *Angrist and Pischke (2014)* will introduce students to difference-in-differences designs, while *Wing, Simon and Bello-Gomez (2018)* provide more detailed advice for the use of this design in applied research. 
* *Sovey and Green (2011)* introduce instrumental variables and provide guidelines for their application in political science. 

Some students may find some of the readings (such as Ward and Ahlquist (2018)) to be technically demanding. If so:  Do not despair!  We will use the lectures to clarify and provide intuition.  However, we do encourage you to not skip the equations.  A useful approach is to engage actively with the examples.  Working through as much as possible of the maths will give you a much better grasp of the material.

**Recommended readings**

Sometimes we understand things better when they are explained in different ways.  You may find it useful to consult the following books for alternative explanations throughout the course:  Fox (2008) and Stock and Watson (2012) are useful for thefirst part of the course (weeks 1-3), Cunningham (forthcoming) is useful for the second part of the course (weeks 4-5), and Hermansen (2019) is useful for getting up to speed in R.

---&gt;
&lt;!---## Flexibility
This feature can be used for publishing content such as:

* **Online courses**
* **Project or software documentation**
* **Tutorials**

The `courses` folder may be renamed. For example, we can rename it to `docs` for software/project documentation or `tutorials` for creating an online course.

## Delete tutorials

**To remove these pages, delete the `courses` folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.**

## Update site menu

After renaming or deleting the `courses` folder, you may wish to update any `[[main]]` menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at `config/_default/menus.toml`.

For example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:

```toml
[[main]]
  name = &#34;Courses&#34;
  url = &#34;courses/&#34;
  weight = 50
```

Or, if you are creating a software documentation site, you can rename the `courses` folder to `docs` and update the associated *Courses* menu configuration to:

```toml
[[main]]
  name = &#34;Docs&#34;
  url = &#34;docs/&#34;
  weight = 50
```

## Update the docs menu

If you use the *docs* layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form `[menu.X]` where `X` is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the `courses/example/` folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within `courses/example/` from `[menu.example]` to `[menu.&lt;NewFolderName&gt;]`.

---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the European Court of Justice respond to political divisions by authoritatively settling or cautiously avoiding salient legal matters? The existing literature suggests the former but this chapter, surveying 920 free movement of persons judgments, suggests the latter: the Court issues fewer audacious rulings in times of uneven political support while also disproportionately increasing chamber size. The findings cast the Court as a selectively audacious lawmaker, primarily concerned with procedural legitimacy. They nuance the established narrative of the Court as the motor of integration able and willing to make law in times of political stalemate and legislative paralysis. More broadly, the chapter demonstrates that courts do not make policy in lieu of legislators when and because they can but avoid policymaking if and until they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article presents the CJEU Database Platform, which provides scholars with an extensive
collection of easily accessible, research-ready data on the the universe of cases, decisions, and judges at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CJEU Database Platform
provides a foundation for the broader CJEU Database currently being developed by The

      <title>Judicial behavior: Decision makers in the CJEU</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Little research exists on how judges enter the Court and how its internal organization affects decision making.  This project opens the black box of these decision-making processes to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I show that judges&amp;rsquo; performance and governments&amp;rsquo; political preferences are intertwined both when judges are appointed and when influence is distributed within the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shaping the Bench: The Effect of Ideology, Impact, and Information Quality on Judicial Reappointments&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;  with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Effectplot_preferences_economy_CJ.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;Graphic showing that the likelihood of replacing a sitting judge increases with the distance between the economic preferences of the appointing and reappointing government.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts’ institutional design has significant implications for judicial independence and accountability, particularly when terms are renewable. Policy-seeking selectors often consider judges’ past service to predict their future policy impact. However, the same judicial record may carry more or less weight in the assessment, depending on the court’s case-management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on original data on reappointments to the Court of Justice of the European Union, we show that reappointments are made based on both ideology and impact. Transparent, selective allocation of influential positions in the court favors the retention of high-impact judges, while non-selective allocations do not. Secret voting &amp;ndash; conventionally seen as safeguarding judicial independence &amp;ndash; also does not shield judges against ideological deselection. Our analysis unveils new insights into when judicial accountability incentivizes effort. It also challenges the prevailing belief that renewable terms decrease judicial independence, instead suggesting that selectors partially rely on evaluations by court members for reappointment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments create monitoring entities to ensure that policymakers are working effectively. Monitors&amp;rsquo; control over retaining and selecting policymakers, however, may create incentives that lead to sub-optimal outcomes. One such entity is a merit commission (also known as a judicial council) that evaluates judges subject to retention and (or) selection. How do merit commissions affect judicial behavior? We construct a formal model arguing that lower competence incumbent judges only subject to merit retention will complete cases more quickly at the expense of quality opinion-writing, as their productivity is a signal of their effort investment to the commission. Conversely, judges subject to merit selection and subsequent retention will not make the same tradeoff, as the commission&amp;rsquo;s initial selection of them makes it more costly for the commission to negatively evaluate them upon retention. We provide evidence leveraging the Article 255 panel for (re)appointments to the Court of Justice of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can governments influence the ideological direction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) through judicial appointments? How does the internal allocation of responsibilities, such as the assignment of reporting judges, affect CJEU decisions? These questions have been difficult to answer given that the CJEU publishes its judgments as a collective. We present a simple model in which a reporting judge is assigned the responsibility to propose a draft judgment to a panel, which can then amend and vote on it. The model yields several observable implications, including that both the ideological preferences of the median and the reporter judge influence Court decisions. We test the implications of the model using all state aid annulment cases against EU Commission decisions brought either by private litigants or governments in the 1990-2021 period. We find that as the median judge is appointed by a more left-wing government, the Court becomes more likely to rule in favor of state aid. The ideological preferences of the reporting judge also shape Court decisions. These findings shed new light on both the judicial behavior of the Court and its alleged neoliberal bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;published-work&#34;&gt;Published work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If who makes decisions within courts matters for the outcome of cases and their reception, then studying how cases and judges are matched is essential to understanding judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does the President of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) make strategic use of his members?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases in the CJEU areprepared  by  a  “judge-rapporteur”  who  acts  as  an  agenda  setter. I argue that the President builds the Court’s legitimacy by strategically allocating cases to select judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using original data on 9623 case allocations (1980-2015), I argue that suspicions about judges’ political accountability can polarize already politicized debates.  The President circumvents such dynamicsby  appointing  a  rapporteur  whose  government  holds  moderate  political  preferences.   However,  he  considers  governmental  preferencesand disagreements mainly when case law is not yet developed.  This may  also  contribute  to  explaining  judges individual-level  specialization, which arguably favors the construction of a coherent case law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results speak to the lingering effect of judges’ renewable terms &amp;ndash; despite secret voting &amp;ndash; as well as the importance of courts internalorganization for judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
