&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does biased political recruitment -- and the legislation of gender quotas -- affect the quality of representation? The article theorizes that biased selection implies a higher hurdle for women than for men. As a consequence, fewer -- but more talented and ambitious -- female legislators enter office. When quotas are legislated, the bias lingers but takes new forms. Uncertain about their initial choice, parties compensate by drawing on incumbent women&#39;s legislative record to update their beliefs. Quota women are thus more accountable.
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a &amp;ldquo;before-after&amp;rdquo; design with a control group, this study investigates legislators&amp;rsquo; effort, performance, ambition, and reselection to the European Parliament (1999-2014). It demonstrates that non-quota women handled more high-impact legislation and aimed at longer careers than other legislators. When quotas were imposed, the share of women did not increase. However, quota women had a higher pay off from performing well in office and reacted by increasing their effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
