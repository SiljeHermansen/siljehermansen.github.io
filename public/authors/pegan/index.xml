&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentarians receive public funding to employ staff in the constituency helping them execute their representative mandate. However, local staff is also an electoral asset. We draw on theories of personal-vote seeking to study local staff as an example of constituency service. Modelling within-individual changes in local-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), we find that staff size increases before both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centred systems. This leads us to conclude that - despite a single staff system for all MEPs - EU citizens are represented differently depending on where they elect their members. The attempt to mend EU&#39;s democratic deficit by financing members&#39; contact with citizens further implies funding incumbent European candidates and challengers in national campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
