By going to court, private and public actors can claim their EU rights, argue their case before the European Court of Justice (ECJ), and shape subsequent debates and supranational policies. In this chapter, we situate EU law litigation in a broader comparative context by answering three questions: who litigates EU law, who influences ECJ decisions, with what downstream effects? We first draw on existing empirical legal studies (ELS) to compare whether well-established litigation patterns in the United States also appear to arise in the EU. While research in both contexts suggests that it is the “haves” (businesses and interest groups clustered in cities) who disproportionately litigate, studies of the EU context disagree about whether the capacity to litigate automatically begets judicial influence and downstream effects. To advance this debate, we systematically map the litigation propensities and relative influence of various types of litigants using an original dataset of 7353 cases referred by national courts to the ECJ from 1957 to 2018. We uncover several illuminating patterns that open pathways for future research. First, EU law litigation is not only driven by resourceful business and trade associations, but also by a surprising abundance of resourceless individuals and a striking paucity of labor unions and advocacy groups, although these patterns vary across member states. Second, individuals, labor unions, and trade associations are most effective in influencing the ECJ, but in opposing and counterintuitive ways: whereas labor unions and individuals prompt liberalizing rulings that restrict national autonomy, trade associations prompt protectionist rulings that safeguard national autonomy. Finally, individuals and advocacy groups are better able to attract attention and shape downstream legal debates via EU law litigation than businesses and trade associations. The “haves” are certainly protagonists of EU law litigation, but they are neither the sole nor the most effective protagonists.\nReference\nSilje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen and Tommaso Pavone (2025). \u0026ldquo;EU Law Litigation: Who Litigates, Who Influences Judges, What Downstream Effects?\u0026rdquo; In Empirical Legal Studies of EU Law.

University of Copenhagen. Department of Political Science. 2025\nFar from impartial interpreters of the law, courts often shape and are shaped by politics. The judicialization of politics—the phenomenon by which an increasing number of political and societal values are allocated by courts rather than elected politicians—has become a defining feature of governance in Europe. At its helm is the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Courts would have no political role if judges simply applied the law and politicians readily complied with their rulings. Instead, legislators often leave high courts with extensive interpretative discretion, while judges lack the power to enforce their decisions. The result is a strategic interplay where courts navigate their independence within political constraints.\nWe will ask questions like:\nAre judges’ political preferences reflected in their decisions? Is there a tradeoff between competence and ideology? How do we balance judicial independence with accountability? What is the influence of public opinion on courts’ willingness to challenge governments? How do governments shape high court decisions? What mechanisms shape judicial legitimacy? The course draws on a variety of political science research methods, including quantitative, qualitative, and formal approaches. Students will engage with a mix of classics in the field and cutting-edge research to evaluate judicial behavior, institutional design, and the broader implications of courts in democratic governance. This course is relevant for students looking to study EU decision making from a different angle and those interested in the strategic dynamics of political institutions in established democracies.\nPlease familiarize with the reading list.

The article theorizes that biased selection implies a higher hurdle for women than for men. As a consequence, fewer -- but more talented and ambitious -- female legislators enter office. When quotas are legislated, the bias lingers but takes new forms. Uncertain about their initial choice, parties compensate by drawing on incumbent women's legislative record to update their beliefs. Quota women are thus more accountable.\rDrawing on a \u0026ldquo;before-after\u0026rdquo; design with a control group, this study investigates legislators\u0026rsquo; effort, performance, ambition, and reselection to the European Parliament (1999-2014). It demonstrates that non-quota women handled more high-impact legislation and aimed at longer careers than other legislators. When quotas were imposed, the share of women did not increase. However, quota women had a higher pay off from performing well in office and reacted by increasing their effort.\nReference\nHermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder (2025) \u0026ldquo;Lingering bias: the effects of legislated gender quotas on representation quality in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo; European Union Politics, 26 (1), pp 66-95.

In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.\nElection seeking National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. Their position is instead close to that of voters: They can hold representatives accountable by observing how they perform in office and either reselect or replace incumbent candidates in the next election.

We argue that ICs can refract private litigation to build legitimacy and mitigate intergovernmental backlash. By leveling the odds for individuals and spotlighting their claims over those of more resourceful litigants, ICs cultivate civil society support and legitimate judicial policymaking in intergovernmental polities where individuals are disempowered. We evaluate this argument by scrutinizing the first IC with private access: the European Court of Justice (ECJ). We trace how ECJ judges privilege individuals in their advocacy and assess if they match words with deeds. Leveraging an original dataset, we find that the ECJ \u0026ldquo;levels\u0026rdquo;, supporting individual claims over businesses boasting larger and more experienced legal teams. The ECJ also \u0026ldquo;spotlights\u0026rdquo; its support for individuals through press releases that get amplified in law reviews.

However, it remains unclear whether knowledge of court procedures or lawyers\u0026rsquo; familiarity with the judges drives these results. We argue that a lawyer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;courtroom capital\u0026rdquo; is primarily rooted in their familiarity with specific judges. Given the significance of knowing the judges, we also anticipate that lawyers are more likely to win in court when they argue cases orally in court, in front of judges they are acquainted with.\nWe investigate our claims in the context of the General Court of the European Union, where lawyers may encounter different judges and not all cases have oral hearings. We find that it is familiarity with the reporting judge, and not familiarity with court procedures, that increases lawyers win rates. Our results also reveal that lawyers familiarity with judges only pays off in cases with oral hearings.\nPublished work \u0026ldquo;EU Law Litigation: Who Litigates, Who Influences Judges, What Downstream Effects?\u0026quot; (2025) with Tommaso Pavone.

The Court\u0026rsquo;s relationship with governments Judicious judging: The effects of political division on decision making in the European Court of Justice with Urska Sadl presented at APSA 2022 (Montréal) How do courts react to political debate? Their legitimacy hinges on their ability to uphold the law impervious to political pressure. The authority of the ruling follows from the court\u0026rsquo;s reputation as apolitical. Politicization – understood as salient questions that divide stakeholders – threatens to erode this image. It imposes conflicting demands: Courts can prove their worth by solving questions for which there is a demand for a legal solution, but they risk their reputation in a politically divided environment.\nLiterature on judicial independence focuses on direct and explicit threats issued by the political branch. Arguments of legislative override typically predict that political division empowers the judiciary. In contrast, we argue that courts are sensitive even to the potential eruption of conflict because they value their diffuse legitimacy. Effective judicial policy making is thus a question of strategic timing.\nTo test our theory, we study the European Court of Justice. Known as the “dark horse of integration”, it is an independent court with political sway. Yet political considerations profoundly affects its decision making. We draw on unprecedented data mapping out the legal ambit of all preliminary cases relating to the Free movement of people throughout the history. We find that the Court holds back on the legal ambit of rulings, preferring to bolster its institutional authority, in times of political division. Reversely, it broadens the ambit when salience is high and conflict low. Thus, when salience and division combine, they null each other out; leaving traces only in the decision-making process.\nPublished work Sadl, Urska, Silje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen (2024) \u0026ldquo;The European Court of Justice, an able and unwilling lawmaker: evidence from 920 free movement of persons judgments\u0026rdquo; Revisiting Judicial Politics in the European Union.

The existing literature suggests the former but this chapter, surveying 920 free movement of persons judgments, suggests the latter: the Court issues fewer audacious rulings in times of uneven political support while also disproportionately increasing chamber size. The findings cast the Court as a selectively audacious lawmaker, primarily concerned with procedural legitimacy. They nuance the established narrative of the Court as the motor of integration able and willing to make law in times of political stalemate and legislative paralysis. More broadly, the chapter demonstrates that courts do not make policy in lieu of legislators when and because they can but avoid policymaking if and until they can.\nReference\nSadl, Urska, Silje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen (2024) \u0026ldquo;The European Court of Justice, an able and unwilling lawmaker: evidence from 920 free movement of persons judgments\u0026rdquo; Revisiting Judicial Politics in the European Union, Ed.

However, local staff is also an electoral asset. We draw on theories of personal-vote seeking to study local staff as an example of constituency service. Modelling within-individual changes in local-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), we find that staff size increases before both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centred systems. This leads us to conclude that - despite a single staff system for all MEPs - EU citizens are represented differently depending on where they elect their members. The attempt to mend EU's democratic deficit by financing members' contact with citizens further implies funding incumbent European candidates and challengers in national campaigns.\nReference\nHermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder and Andreja Pegan (2023) \u0026ldquo;Blurred lines between electoral and parliamentary representation: The use of constituency staff among Members of the European Parliament\u0026rdquo; European Union Politics, 24 (2), pp 239–263.

This project opens the black box of these decision-making processes to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior.\nI show that judges\u0026rsquo; performance and governments\u0026rsquo; political preferences are intertwined both when judges are appointed and when influence is distributed within the Court.\nJudicial appointments to the CJEU \u0026ldquo;Shaping the Bench: The Effect of Ideology and Influence on Judicial Reappointments\u0026rdquo; with Daniel Naurin forthcoming in The Journal of Politics Judicial appointments allow selectors to advance policy goals by appointing influential judges who share their ideological preferences. Under renewable terms, judicial records provide information that helps identify desirable candidates. While prior research focuses on judicial voting, we examine how expectations about judges’ ideology and influence on case law shape reappointments.\nUsing original data on all potential reappointments to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), we show that secret voting \u0026ndash; intended to safeguard judicial independence \u0026ndash; fails to shield judges from ideological deselection. However, reappointment levels remain high because governments recognize the need to translate preferences into policies. Peer selection for influential court positions signals who will obtain influence. Holding many such positions, therefore, favors judges’ reappointment, while non-selective processes do not. Our findings challenge the belief that renewable terms weaken judicial independence, showing that selectors trade ideology for influence by relying on peer evaluations for reappointments.

Evidence from the Court of Justice of the European Union\u0026rdquo; with Sivaram Cheruvu, Joshua Fjelstul, and Daniel Naurin presented at APSA 2022 (Montréal) Governments create monitoring entities to ensure that policymakers are working effectively. Monitors\u0026rsquo; control over retaining and selecting policymakers, however, may create incentives that lead to sub-optimal outcomes. One such entity is a merit commission (also known as a judicial council) that evaluates judges subject to retention and (or) selection. How do merit commissions affect judicial behavior? We construct a formal model arguing that lower competence incumbent judges only subject to merit retention will complete cases more quickly at the expense of quality opinion-writing, as their productivity is a signal of their effort investment to the commission. Conversely, judges subject to merit selection and subsequent retention will not make the same tradeoff, as the commission\u0026rsquo;s initial selection of them makes it more costly for the commission to negatively evaluate them upon retention. We provide evidence leveraging the Article 255 panel for (re)appointments to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nInternal organization and decision making \u0026ldquo;Ideology and Agenda Setting on the Court of Justice of European Union: Evidence from Anti-Trust and State Aid Cases\u0026rdquo; with Erik Voeten presented at the EPSA annual conference 2024 (Cologne) Can governments influence the ideological direction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) through judicial appointments? How does the internal allocation of responsibilities, such as the assignment of reporting judges, affect CJEU decisions? These questions have been difficult to answer given that the CJEU publishes its judgments as a collective. We present a simple model in which a reporting judge proposes a draft judgment to a panel, which can then amend and vote on it. The model yields several observable implications, including that both the ideological preferences of the median and the reporting judge influence Court decisions and that the agenda setting power of the reporting judge increases when other judges face higher costs for drafting alternative opinions. We test the implications of the model using annulment cases against EU Commission decisions relating to competition policy brought either by private litigants or governments in the 1990-2021 period. We find that as the median and the reporting judge are appointed by more economically left-wing governments, the Court increasingly rules in favor of government intervention in the economy.\nA draft version can be found here.\nPublished work If who makes decisions within courts matters for the outcome of cases and their reception, then studying how cases and judges are matched is essential to understanding judicial independence.\n\u0026ldquo;The politics of the Court of Justice of the European Union: A review\u0026rdquo; (2026) with Gabel, Matthew and Jay Krehbiel (2026) European Union Politics. 27(1), 1-45.\n\u0026ldquo;The CJEU Database Platform: Decisions and Decision-Makers\u0026rdquo; (2023) with Stein Arne Brekke, Joshua Fjelstul and Daniel Naurin.

Formålet med denne workshopen er å gi deg den grunnleggende kunnskapen du trenger for å navigere R på egenhånd. Du blir ingen ekspert, men etter våre to dager sammen, vil du ha et innblikk i \u0026ndash; og førstehånds erfaring med \u0026ndash; hvordan R fungerer.\nDette er en workshop. Det betyr at vi jobber aktivt i R sammen gjennom hele kurset. Ta med deg laptop-en din og gjør deg klar til å skrive! I forkant bør du allerede ha installert R (https://www.r-project.org/; statistikkprogrammet) og RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/; brukergrensesnittet). Om du møter på problemer, kan du også møte opp en halvtime tidligere på tirsdag.\nAlle skal med! Derfor kan vi justere på programmet underveis. Jeg vil dele r-notatene mine gjennom kurset. De vil dere finne på denne linken: https://siljehermansen.github.io/teaching/oslomet).\nFørste workshop: Introduksjon til R Tid: kl. 09.30-15.00; 30.-31. august 2022\nDag 1: De første byggesteinene Sted: Ingeniørhuset, rom PH424\nFørste dag jobber vi i base-R. Fokuset er på å bli kjent med R-språket og få på plass gode arbeidsrutiner.\nSesjon 1: Kom i gang\nSesjon 2-3: Datatyper, objekter og funksjoner\nSesjon 4: R som tegneprogram\nSesjon 5: Arbeidsflyt\nDag 2: Analyse i R Sted: Sykepleierhuset, rom N040.012\nAndre dag begynner vi med analyser. Nå introduserer jeg også andre R-dialekter.\nI forkant av workshopen, kan du installere de følgende R-pakkene: tidyverse (denne kan ta tid), dplyr, ggplot2, kableExtra. stargazer og MASS. Dette gjør du ved å skrive install.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) i R-konsollen.\nSesjon 6: Beskrivende statistikk\nI denne sesjonen skal vi bruke data fra kapittel 5 i Lær deg R. Dette er data fra den norske runden av ESS (2014). Du kan laste dem ned her.\nSesjon 7-8: Tilrettelegging av data\nI denne sesjonen skal vi bruke data fra kapittel 6 i Lær deg R. Dette er data fra den norske runden av ESS (2014) samt Chapel Hill Survey fra samme år.\nAndre workshop: Visualisering Tid: kl. 09.30-12.00; 10. oktober 2022\nSted: Pilestredet 35, Ellen Gleditschs hus: PI451\nI denne workshopen fokuserer vi på visualisering. Vi begynner med å lage tabeller. Deretter går vi gjennom noen av de grafiske mulighetene som R tilbyr.\nSelv om vi fokuserer på beskrivende statistikk og presentasjon idag, har flere av teknikkene vi bruker mye til felles både med hva vi har sett tidligere og hva vi skal gjøre framover. Vi benytter sjansen til å gjenta noe av hva vi gjorde da vi tilrettela data. Vi varmer også opp til dynamisk rapportering og modellering, som vi skal se neste gang vi møtes.\nDataene vi skal bruke idag, kommer også fra ESS (2014). Jeg bruker en tilrettelagt versjon for Norge i Lær deg R (kapittel 7).\nSesjon 9: Tabeller: dplyr, tidyr og kableExtra\nVi begynner dagen med tabeller. I denne sesjonen bruker vi dplyr-, tidyr- og kableExtra-pakkene. Sistnevnte har du muligens ikke installert enda.\nSesjon 10: Mer tegning: ggplot2\nVi tar et bad i ggplot2: R er blitt populært ikke minst på grunn av visualiseringsmulighetene det tilbyr. ggplot2-pakken har vært instrumentell i denne utviklingen.\nTredje workshop: Modellering og dynamisk rapportering Tid: kl. 09.30-12.00; 2. desember 2022\nSted: Arbeidsforskningsinstituttet, OsloMet\nKursholder: Silje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen, Førsteamuanensis, Universitetet i København\nEpost: silje.hermansen@ifs.ku.dk\nWebside: https://siljehermansen.github.io\nVelkommen til en ny R-workshop! Til nå har vi fokusert på arbeidsflyten i R, datatilrettelegging og beskrivende statistikk. I desember vil vi endelig gå gjennom modellering i R og hvordan vi kan rapportere resultatene.\nR åpner for mange ulike modelleringer tilgjenglig i ulike pakker. De bygger alle på samme lest. For denne workshopen fokuserer vi derfor på basismodellene: lineære modeller. Vi vil gå gjennom syntaksen for modellen, samt hvordan vi kan presentere resultatene med tall, ord og tegning.\nOfte produserer vi liknende dokumenter basert på samme type data og analyser. Dette er typisk for årlige rapporteringer (f.eks. årsstatistikk), men også for nye versjoner av forskningsarbeidene våre (f.eks et nytt konferansepaper). Selve dataene og resultatene endrer seg ofte mellom disse versjonene: Vi har nye data (f.eks. data for et nytt år eller nyinnsamlede/korrigerte data) og dermed endrer også resultatene seg. Derimot er ofte selve analyseteksten og strukturen den samme mellom ulike versjoner. Da er det nyttig å bruke dynamiske rapporter som automatisk integrerer endringene.\nR kan integreres med tekstbehandling for å produsere Word-, LaTeX- eller html-dokumenter. Da \u0026ldquo;flettes\u0026rdquo; R-kodene sammen med teksten, tabellene og grafikkene og resultatene oppdateres. Dette gjør det mulig å dokumentere og oppdatere hva vi gjør underveis. Løsningen gjør det mulig å skrive papere, rapporter, \u0026ldquo;notatblokker\u0026rdquo;, lysbilder/slides, websider og interaktive \u0026ldquo;apper\u0026rdquo;.\nI denne workshopen går jeg gjennom hovedprinsippene og demonstrerer noen av mulighetene som RStudio åpner for oss. Jeg viser hvordan vi kan lage tekstdokumenter hvor vi integrerer resulattabeller, språklig og visuell tolkning. Dette er enormt arbeidsbesparende! Denne workshopen introduserer nettopp denne arbeidsflyten.\nJeg vil basere introduksjonen på rmarkdown-språket og pandoc-løsningen. Du kan få en oversikt over mulighetene her: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html\nI forkant av workshopen bør du ha installert rmarkdown. Du kan finne instrukser her: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/installation.html\nSesjon 11: Regresjoner: Analyse og tolkning\nData for sesjonen: kap7\nFjerde workshop: Skraping i R (Automatisert datainnsamling) Tid: kl. 09.00-12.00; 6. januar 2023\nSted: Arbeidsforskningsinstituttet, OsloMet (Pilestredet 46, Clara Holst hus: PA314)\nDet finnes et hav av digital informasjon der ute som vi kan bruke som data. Da er \u0026ldquo;skraping\u0026rdquo; (automatisert datainnsamling) gull verdt. Automatisert datainnsamling er noe av det smarteste jeg lærte under doktorgraden. Dataene jeg bruker i forskningen min kommer i all hovedsak fra digitale dokumenter som R har prosessert for meg.\nAutomatisert datainnsamling er ikke vanskelig, men det kan være en tålmodighetsprøve. Så lenge informasjonen vi er ute etter er strukturert med tekst eller i en html-liste, vil vi kunne fortelle en datamaskin hvordan dataene skal hentes ut og sorteres. Skraping er stordriftsøkonomi. Det krever en del tid å finne datastrukturen, men når dette er gjort, kan vi sette R til å jobbe for oss. Det er magisk!\nI denne workshopen skal vi gå gjennom hovedprinsippene for hvordan vi leser tekst fra nettsider og hvordan vi kan hente ut informasjon fra denne teksten og legge den inn i en datamatrise. I prosessen får vi bruk for indekseringen og de regelmessige uttrykkene vi har lært tidligere. Vi kommer også til å gå gjennom tips og triks for stordriftsøkonomi i R ved hjelp av funksjoner og løkker.\nDu kan komme til workshopen med varierende ambisjonsnivå. Vi skal gå gjennom en typisk arbeidsprosess for automatisert datainnsamling. I tillegg vil jeg gi noen indikasjoner på hvilke avveininger som er lure å gjøre når vi lager en innsamlingsstratgi. På slutten av workshopen, vil du kjenne til hovedprinsippene for slik datainnsamling og kan begynne med ditt eget prosjekt. Men du kan også bruke workshopen som en demonstrasjon av R-triks vi allerede er blitt kjent med og hanke inn ekstra tips for hvordan gjøre R-kodingen mer effektiv når du tilrettelegger data.\nJeg vil dele r-notatene mine gjennom kurset. De vil dere finne på denne linken: https://siljehermansen.github.io/teaching).\nHente ut data fra tekst\nVi begynner med å surfe nettet. Første skritt er å legge en strategi: Hvilken informasjon er vi ute etter? Hvordan tenker vi at datamatrisen vår skal se ut? Hvilken informasjon er tilgjengelig? Selv om vi til slutt vil lese inn informasjon fra mange ulike nettsider, vil vi begynne med et typisk eksempel på én observasjon (ett dokument).\nDeretter begynner arbeidet. Vi leser nettsiden for det første eksempelet inn i R og bruker indekseringsverktøyet for å hente ut dataene vi ønsker oss. For å gjøre dette, ser vi etter regelmessigheter i tekstdokumentet.\nMangfoldiggjøring\nNeste skritt er mangfoldiggjøring. Vi har skrevet en R-kode som henter ut informasjon for én observasjon. R-koden vil som oftest innebære flere operasjoner som skal gjøres etter hverandre mange ganger. Da er det nyttig å skrive en løkke (en \u0026ldquo;loop\u0026rdquo;).\nPå dette tidspunktet vi jobbe fram og tilbake mellom eksempler og mangfoldiggjøring. Det vil si, ofte finnes det enten uregelmessigheter i kildene våre eller flere alternative tekststrukturer. Da er det praktisk å skrive en algoritme. En algoritme bygger på en enkel logikk hvor vi skriver ulike kodesnutter for ulike tekststrukturer og starter hver kodesnutt med et \u0026ldquo;hvis/hvis-ikke\u0026rdquo;-spørsmål.\nFor de som er interessert, vil vi til sist skrive vår egen funksjon. Det gjør at R arbeider fortere, og gjør R-kodene våre lettere å lese.\nPostprosessering og andre triks\nTil sist, vil vi gå gjennom ulike tips og triks for arbeid i R. Dette er nyttig uansett om vi har skrapet dataene selv, eller bare har data og filer vi ønsker å tilrettelegge.\nNår dataene er samlet inn, gjenstår det vanlige arbeidet med å rense dem. Da vil vi nok en gang få bruk for de regelmessige uttrykkene vi har sett i løpet av høsten.\n","date":1672963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672963200,"objectID":"785d782189b8801b9cc8321b0fd1b6ae","permalink":"/teaching/oslomet/","publishdate":"2023-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/oslomet/","section":"teaching","summary":"Sted: Arbeidsforskningsinstituttet, OsloMet\nKursholder: Silje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen\nEpost: silje.hermansen@ifs.ku.dk\nVelkommen til R workshop!

Det er\rfint, for da kan R gjøre unna det kjedelige arbeidet, mens jeg gjør\randre ting.\nAutomatisert datainnsamling er ikke vanskelig, men det kan være en\rtålmodighetsprøve. Så lenge informasjonen vi er ute etter er\rstrukturert med tekst eller i en html-liste, vil vi kunne fortelle en\rdatamaskin hvordan dataene skal hentes ut og sorteres. Skraping er stordriftsøkonomi. Det krever en del tid å finne datastrukturen, men når dette er gjort, kan vi sette R til å jobbe for oss. Det er magisk!\nVi skal samle inn data fra EUR-Lex. EUR-Lex er nettsiden hvor\ralle EU sine offisielle dokumenter befinner seg for offentlig innsyn.\rSpesifikt, er jeg interessert i å samle inn “metainformasjon” om\rdomsavsigelser fra EU-domstolen. Metainformasjon her betyr at jeg\rikke er interessert i selve dommen, men informasjon rundt den.\rHva er tittelen på dommen og når ble den publisert?\nEt eksempel er Coman-saken\rhvor EU-domstolen gikk langt i å annerkjenne homoekteskap for alle\rEU-borgere (2016).\nVi kan dele arbeidet inn i flere faser:\nJeg legger en strategi hvor jeg definerer målet\rmitt presist (strukturen til en datamatrise) og en skisse over veien dit\r(hvilken informasjon jeg skal bruke og hvor den befinner seg). Dette er\ren kartleggingsfase.\nJeg arbeider fram en konkret taktikk for hvordan\rinformasjonen skal hentes ut. Teksten jeg skraper (rådataene) kan være\rstrukturert ulikt, derfor trenger jeg ulike taktikker for ulike\rvariabler. Hvis informasjonen jeg er ute etter, er plassert ulikt i\rulike dokumenter, vil jeg også ha alternative taktikker for ulike\robservasjoner i samme variabel. Hver taktikk er en egen kodesnutt som\rhenter informasjonen jeg trenger. Det er dette arbeidet som tar mest\rtid, og jeg begynner alltid med ett eksempel (en observasjon på en\rvariabel).\nJeg skraper (samler inn) alle dataene\r(datapunktene). Nå går jeg fra ett eksempel til å samle inn informasjon\rfra alle dokumentene/sidene jeg er interessert i. Denne delen av\rarbeidsprosessen innebærer å gå fram og tilbake mellom skraping og\rkorrigering av taktikken min. I prosessen vil jeg generalisere\rR-koden min slik at den er funksjonell for alle dokumenter. Ofte vil jeg\rmøte på problemer som krever nye taktikker og/eller en justering av den\rgamle. Dette er når jeg luker feil.\nLegg en strategi: Hva vil jeg oppnå?\rKartlegging\rFørste skritt i en datainnsamlingsprosess er å kartlegge hvilken\rinformasjon jeg ønsker og hvilken som finnes. For å finne ut mer,\rbegynner jeg med å surfe nettet på vanlig vis. Et viktig poeng er å\rfinne ut om informasjonen jeg ønsker faktisk er tilgjengelig for alle\robservasjoner/nettsider.\nJeg bestemmer meg så for datastrukturen jeg ønsker for matrisen min\r(sluttproduktet). I vårt eksempel, ønsker jeg en matrise hvor hver\robservasjon (linje) er en domsavsigelse, og hver variabel gir en\rspesifikk type informasjon om avsigelsen. I dette tilfellet er jeg\rinteressert i datoen for dokumentet.\nSpesifiser en taktikk: Jobb med eksempler\rSelv om målet med datainnsamlingen er en datamatrise med flere\rvariabler og mange observasjoner, men jeg begynner alltid med en\robservasjon og en variabel. Det vil si at jeg jobber med et typisk\reksempel på dokumentene jeg skal samle data fra. “Typisk” betyr her\rat dokumentet følger strukturen til flest mulig av dokumentene jeg skal\rskrape fra.\nJeg har valgt meg Coman-dommen som et typisk eksempel. Den finnes\rher: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62016CJ0673\nVi ser at teksten på siden er strukturert. Blant annet ser vi at\rdatoet på dokumentet (“Date of document”) er annsert i tykk blå skrift\retterfulgt av selve datoen i svart skrift. For nettsider er denne\rstrukturen definert av html-koder. Html blir brukt for å definere\rlayouten i en tekst.\nFor å se html-strukturen, kan du høyreklikke på siden og velge “View\rpage source”. Et nytt vindu åpner seg, og vi kan se hvordan dokumentet\rser ut bak kulissene. Nå blir det klart for oss at teksten vi ser på\rselve nettsiden egentlig er en liste hvor all informasjon er lagt inn\rsom egne punkter. Html-lista er ikke egentlig laget for å strukturere\rdata, men vi kan bruke html-strukturen til vår fordel.\nNå kan vi finne fram til informasjonen vi ønsker og identifisere hvor\ri lista den ligger. Punkter i denne lista heter “noder”. Noder kan ha\rulike navn avhengig av hvordan man ønsker at teksten ser ut. Dette er\rdet vi bruker for å finne fram til våre data.\nFor å finne nodenavnet til datoen til dommsavsigelsen, gjør jeg et\rtekstsøk. Tast “Ctrl+F” og skriv inn “Date of document”. Vi ser at “Date\rof document” ligger i en node som er kalt dt og at selve\rdatoen ligger i en node kalt “dd”. Begge hører til en node kalt “dl”.\rDisse er “søsken” fordi de har samme forelder. Vi ser også at det finnes\randre søsken i flokken (“Date lodged”).\nVi ønsker bare å samle inn datoen for selve dokumentet, så første\rutfordring er å gjøre samme søk i R. La oss åpne R studio.\nJeg begynner med å hente inn `rvest``-pakken for skraping i R fra\rbiblioteket. Om du ikke har installert den enda, må du gjøre dette\rførst.\nlibrary(rvest)\rDet først jeg må gjøre er å definere nettadressen for siden jeg\rønsker å skrape.\nurl \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62016CJ0673\u0026quot;\rlibrary(rvest)\rNå kan jeg la R lese inn html-filen fra denne adressen. Jeg lagrer\rresultatet i et objekt kalt doc. Vi kan ta en titt på\rdoc, men R-studio vil ikke vise oss hele dokumentet. Da\rville korttidsminnet i RStudio bli “spist opp” og programmet\r“henger”.\ndoc \u0026lt;- read_html(url)\rdoc\r## {html_document}\r## \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026quot;en\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;no-js\u0026quot; xml:lang=\u0026quot;en\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r## [1] \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026quot;Content-Type\u0026quot; content=\u0026quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...\r## [2] \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \\n \u0026lt;script type=\u0026quot;application/json\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{\\n \u0026quot;utility\u0026quot; ...\rObjektet er av typen “xml_document”; en liste med mange noder.\nclass(doc)\r## [1] \u0026quot;xml_document\u0026quot; \u0026quot;xml_node\u0026quot;\rJeg kan hente alle noder fram ved å bruke nodenavnet.\nEnkelt, men litt for spesifikt\rhtml_nodes() henter fram alle noder i et\rxml_document-objekt ved hjelp av navnet deres.

It provides information on formal electoral rules as well as national-level and district-level election results for parties and individual politicians (including full candidate lists). The use of existing and new key variables makes it easy to link the data across the different units of observation (country, party, candidate, member of parliament) and join them with external information. Currently, the data cover four elections (1999–2014). Among other aspects, the collection should facilitate research on the European Parliament's allegedly weak electoral connection.

Although few theoretical developments have focused on the eﬀects of expertise on delegation, empirical studies have commonly assumed monotonic eﬀects. Based on the theoretical model by Fischer and Stocken (2001), we argue that more expertise, holding preference divergence constant, has a non-monotonic eﬀect on the probability of being appointed as a rapporteur because of informational credibility. Employing accumulated committee service as an expertise measure, we test this theoretical expectation on all committee report delegations in the European Parliament from 1979 - 2014. Across both nonparametric and parametric hierarchical conditional logit models we ﬁnd support for this non-monotonic eﬀect.

By applying an adverse selection model, I argue that the selectorate looks to past performance to select candidates it expects will gain influence. However, the impact of performance varies according to the need for and availability of information.\nThe European Parliament (EP) provides a most-likely case for information asymmetry. Studying three elections in 11 member states, I find that the allocation of influential positions in office improves chances of reselection. The effect increases when the allocation is more selective, and when the prior uncertainty around candidacies is high. The study thus proposes a new approach to the relationship between national parties and transnational groups in the EP. It also suggests venues for research on parliamentary politics and candidate selection in general.

They are appointed by their political groups. In making these appointments, these groups need to accommodate both their collective needs and individual requests.\nThis article explores situations in which the collective need for information is prioritised: the codecision procedure. The data includes allocations over a 10-year period (2004–2014) in three of the most powerful EP committees, as well as key career choices among members.\nEP groups emphasise policy-specific expertise. They also pay attention to individual members’ requests for exposure, but only when the expected policy drift is minimal. Harsh selection during the allocation of codecision reports creates pressure to accommodate a greater selection of legislators during other attractive report allocations. Own-initiative reports therefore affect allocation of codecision reports negatively.\nOnline supplementary files can be downloaded here\nReference\nHermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder (2018) \u0026ldquo;(Self-)selection and expertise among decision-makers in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo;, The Journal of Legislative Studies, 24 (1), pp 148-172.

National parties organize elections. Parliamentary work is organized around transnational political groups. They do not share any overarching organizational structure. My contributions pertain to the interconnected choices made by MEPs and their two party organizations.\nParliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and -- up to a point -- experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.\nNational parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report alloca-tions dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.\nOutreach\nA popularized presentation in Norwegian on the effect of gender quotas on legislative behavior and parties\u0026rsquo; candidate selection can be found here: \u0026ldquo;Et forsvar for kvinnekvotering\u0026rdquo;\nReference\nHermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder (2017) Choosing Agents: Members of the European Parliament and their Political Organizations Seen through Report Allocation.
